    - Implemented parsing
    - Built test framework

  Nikita
    - Wrote tests

Summary:
  This portion of the project was to implement the parser for
  the Mini GLSL Compiler. This was done using Bison parser
  generator in c. This parser used grammar provided in the lab 
  manual. Scanner provided with lab starter pack was used. 
  The solution also implements "trace parser" 
  functionality (-Tp command-line flag).

  Setting the precedence proved to be challenging, and major
  efforts were spent to achieve correct parsing.
  
  Resolving shift/reduce conflicts was tricky as well. 

  Testing framework from the previous lab was reused with 
  minor alterations. The parser was verified by running 
  various test cases and comparing test output to expected output.
  Errors were sent to the error file, and trace output was
  sent to the trace file. To test the parser's functionality,
  one should enable trace output using the command line option
  -Tp.
