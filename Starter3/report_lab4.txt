Summary:
In order to implement non-trivial math operations, we determined how we could
perform those operations using a combination of the available instructions.
For multiplication, addition, subtraction, and exponentiation there was a 1:1
mapping. For division, we first had to calculate the reciprocal of the second
operand and then multiply the result with the first operand.
